Simple Azure Function that will run a query against the iMIS API 
provided an email address will return an iMIS ID and valid member status (or not).

Don't forget to add App Configuration entries for the local settings you have!!

You'll want to set at least these:
```json
    "iMIS_User" : "", 
    "iMIS_Password" : "", 
    "API_URL" : "https://example.com/api/",
    "Query": "$/FOLDER/query"
```
